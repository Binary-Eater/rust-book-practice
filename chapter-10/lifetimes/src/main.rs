/* Quoting the Rust Book
 *
 * If thereâ€™s a problem with the way a function is annotated or the way it is
 * called, the compiler errors can point to the part of our code and the
 * constraints more precisely. If, instead, the Rust compiler made more
 * inferences about what we intended the relationships of the lifetimes to be,
 * the compiler might only be able to point to a use of our code many steps away
 * from the cause of the problem.

/* Lifetime elision in Rust
 *
 * Rust developers found that there were certain simple patterns that could be
 * simplified with deterministic implicit lifetime rules to avoid needing to
 * annotate all functions with lifetime annotations. Chapter 4's first_word
 * function is an example of a function that works with implicit lifetime
 * elision rules.
 *
 * Rule 1
 *
 *     Each input reference parameter gets its own lifetime.
 *     fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32)
 *     fn foo<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32)
 *
 * Rule 2
 *
 *     If there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, all output lifetime
 *     parameters get the same assignment
 *     fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32) -> &'a i32
 *
 * Rule 3
 *
 *     Multiple input lifetime parameters but one of them is &self or &mut self
 *     (a method), the lifetime of self is assigned to all output parameters
 *     fn foo<'a, 'b>(&'a self, x: &'b i32) -> &'a i32
